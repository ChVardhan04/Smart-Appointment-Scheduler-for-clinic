# **🩺 Smart Appointment Scheduler for Clinics**  

This project is a **Flask-based appointment scheduling system** designed for **clinics and hospitals**.  
It helps **patients** easily schedule appointments with **doctors** based on their specialization and availability. **Doctors** can **approve or reject appointments**, manage their schedules, and provide **online consultations via Google Meet**.  

To enhance the user experience, the system includes **email notifications** to inform patients about their appointment status and integrates a **payment gateway** for online consultations. If a patient selects **online consultation**, the system generates a **Google Meet link**, which is shared upon **doctor approval**. Additionally, the system supports **AI-powered appointment prioritization**, allowing **urgent cases** to be scheduled earlier based on symptom severity.  

This project is ideal for **clinics, hospitals, and telemedicine platforms**, providing an efficient and organized approach to **appointment scheduling, video consultations, and payment processing**.
